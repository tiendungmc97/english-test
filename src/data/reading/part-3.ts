        question:
          "I have a dream of working as a tour guide. So I understand that I will have to fly to other countries. In my personal opinion, airplanes are currently too cheap compared to the damage they cause to the environment. So sometimes I choose other means of transport before they think about flying. I believe that people are also very happy when they can contribute to volunteering to clean up in the neighborhood.",

        question:
          "My family and siblings live quite far from me. So I often have to fly to visit them every month. I don't have other jobs when I appreciate. We can enjoy together, and we are happy to be able to be with each other and share our own stories. I know that people here are much more interested in the environment, so I often shop online or to work by bike instead of going by car or reusing plastic bags and paper bags. In addition, I sometimes volunteer to clean up trash in the neighborhood.",

        question:
          "I'm a businessman so I have to fly many times a week. I have to go to other countries to be able to do wine trading contracts with them. I don't like flying. Neither my wife and I, whenever we have free time, take the train together, and we enjoy the train very much because I can travel while sightseeing and relax without any stress.",

        question:
          "If I have to go somewhere, I will choose other means of public transport, not planes. Every time I go on a plane, I feel extremely tired, and I just hope that planes quickly so I can get off that plane and relax. I go to the specific places of my trip to do so in many different locations, so sometimes I cannot avoid having to take public transportation.",

          "When I first came to this city, I felt very scared because this city is very big. The city has many parts, and the shopping part is very far from the green part. However, we already had the bus route, and we signed up to take the bus for a full day. Buses are very cheap and very convenient. I feel very lucky not to have to put pressure on my sore feet.",

          "I don't like big cities and rarely go out. But I go to Stevenson City very often. I go there about five to seven times a year. There is an area outside the city. In that area, there are many things that I need. There is a lot of water, a natural area, a small forest, and a special camping area. I really like coming to this place to rest. It also has a great coffee serving area for visitors.",

        question:
          "I visit this city last summer and really liked the atmosphere of this city. The reason I like the atmosphere here is because it has a lot of public performances. These performances often take place in front of department stores, so this presents me from shopping inside those stores. I was very surprised when I came home with an empty bag, and I didn't buy anything.",
