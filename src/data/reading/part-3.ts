          "I have a dream of working as a tour guide. So I understand that I will have to fly to other countries. In my personal opinion, airplanes are currently too cheap compared to the damage they cause to the environment. So sometimes I choose other means of transport before they think about flying. I believe that people are also very happy when they can contribute to volunteering to clean up in the neighborhood.",

        question:
          "My family and siblings live quite far from me. So I often have to fly to visit them every month. I don't have other jobs when I appreciate. We can enjoy together, and we are happy to be able to be with each other and share our own stories. I know that people here are much more interested in the environment, so I often shop online or to work by bike instead of going by car or reusing plastic bags and paper bags. In addition, I sometimes volunteer to clean up trash in the neighborhood.",

          "I'm a businessman so I have to fly many times a week. I have to go to other countries to be able to do wine trading contracts with them. I don't like flying. Neither my wife and I, whenever we have free time, take the train together, and we enjoy the train very much because I can travel while sightseeing and relax without any stress.",

          "If I have to go somewhere, I will choose other means of public transport, not planes. Every time I go on a plane, I feel extremely tired, and I just hope that planes quickly so I can get off that plane and relax. I go to the specific places of my trip to do so in many different locations, so sometimes I cannot avoid having to take public transportation.",
